### üë®‚Äçüíª About Me
**‚ÄºÔ∏è DISCLAIMER: most of my work experience were done at past companies in which I cannot share those codebases, I will iteraively add various projects to display my production grade knowledge in AI/ML development as well as random hobby projects. I ultimately am seeking not to spend money on any of these projects as I am not planning (as of now) to make money off them. So if you notice things in my projects where linking to a various API or using x, y, z cloud services would have been a better option just FYI most likely because of cost or rate limiting issues it was not implemented. If you find a better way of going about some projects feel free to reach out! Always seeking new perspectives and grow as an engineer**

- **üî≠ Recent Work: Sports betting tracker for friends, Production Grade YT Comment Sentiment ML Pipeline
- **üå± I‚Äôm learning about Samsung AI model using recursive modeling that ran successfully with greatly less parameters compared to foundational models.
- **üí¨ Ask me about AI, ML, or anything Tech**
- **üì´ How to reach me: ken.balvant.patel@gmail.com**
- **‚ö° Enjoy building AI/ML hobby projects to learn something new**
- **üè° Code from a small mountain town but looking to move to the Bay area to meet like minded individuals**
